function u = CauchyProx(x, gamma, mu)  %,a,b,c,d
% Cauchy proximal operator

% u = arg min_u (||u - x||_2)^2/(2*mu) - log(gamma/(gamma^2 + u^2))

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% INPUT :
%      x      - Input for the proximal operator
%      gamma  - Cauchy scale parameter
%      mu     - FB algorithm step size. It can be chosen in relation with

% OUTPUT :
%      u - the result
